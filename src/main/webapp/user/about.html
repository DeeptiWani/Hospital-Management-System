                <h2>Quality care for end-to-end treatment</h2><br><br>
                <p>A hospital is a healthcare institution providing patient treatment with specialized health science and auxiliary healthcare staff and medical equipment.The best-known type of hospital is the general hospital, which typically has an emergency department to treat urgent health problems ranging from fire and accident victims to a sudden illness. A district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, with many beds for intensive care and additional beds for patients who need long-term care. Specialized hospitals include trauma centers, rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors' (geriatric) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital) and certain disease categories. Specialized hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals.Hospitals are classified as general, specialty, or government depending on the sources of income received.</p><br><br>
                <p>Established in 2007, Newlife Hospital is a tertiary and quaternary healthcare hospital that lays its foundation on a ‘Patient first’ ideology. Our hospitals in New York,USA follow a Greenfield strategy for catering end-to-end healthcare needs of our patients. The first Newlife hospital is situated in the vicinity of the arterial Eastern Express Highway in New York, and offers easy connectivity and accessibility to patients from across New York.
                    <br><br>
                    Going beyond the city, Newlife Hospital extended its services to the city of New York in 2017. And now the multi specialty tertiary and quaternary care hospital is present in Delhi,India too, with Newlife Hospital established in 2020.

We go the extra mile to meet their expectations.</li>
                    <li>We keep ourselves well educated so that we can apply new developments in our fields. We use innovative approaches to health care and customer service.</li>
                    <li>The diverse people who come to Grace Health see themselves reflected in our work. We seek diversity in our staff and value their abilities to enhance communication with patients. We create a clinic physical environment that reflects diversity.
