                            <p class = "text text-sm">Our bones depend on a balanced diet and a continuous supply of nutrients, especially calcium and vitamin D, for their health and strength. People require calcium to develop and maintain healthy bones and teeth. Additionally, it is crucial for other bodily processes like blood circulation and muscle control. Our bodies require vitamin D to absorb calcium from diet effectively. 

                    </p>
                            <p class = "text text-sm">In addition, if the calcium intake in children is not enough, they might not grow to their full potential height. Hence, it is essential to consume the amount of calcium per day that is recommended, through different food sources, vitamins, and supplements.It can also result in other conditions like osteopenia and hypocalcaemia. </p>

                            <h4>How does Calcium Deficiency affect Bone Health?</h4>
                            <p class = "text text-sm">Our bones depend on a balanced diet and a continuous supply of nutrients, especially calcium and vitamin D, for their health and strength. People require calcium to develop and maintain healthy bones and teeth. Additionally, it is crucial for other bodily processes like blood circulation and muscle control. Our bodies require vitamin D to absorb calcium from diet effectively. 

                    </p>
                            <p class = "text text-sm">In addition, if the calcium intake in children is not enough, they might not grow to their full potential height. Hence, it is essential to consume the amount of calcium per day that is recommended, through different food sources, vitamins, and supplements.It can also result in other conditions like osteopenia and hypocalcaemia. </p>
